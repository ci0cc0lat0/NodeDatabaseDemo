Hopefully everything goes off without a hitch.
## To run the files all we really had to do was install nodemon. I believe express and cors are baked into npm.

sudo apt-get install nodemon

We run the project inside the root directory with these commands

npx nodemon index.js

Then on a browser, we load up localhost:3000 and you should be directed to the page.

Hopefully That is all that is needed
Any other bugs or quirks of running the server, message Anthony Ciocco 1600875, dbs018 for information.
