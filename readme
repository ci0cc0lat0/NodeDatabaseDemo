To run the server, in the root directory open a terminal and run 'npx nodemon index.js'
next, look up localhost:3000 on the browser

The default table should have 5 rows
The delete and edit buttons do nothing.

if you type in 'demo' and hit 'Table select' nothing should happen on the website, but the terminal should update with a new 'select all' query
if you type in 'test' and hit 'Table select' the  table should change to undefined and have 3 rows. Repeating the step above should return it to normal

I am looking for a way to display all of the attributes in a table in the top.
Later this will be reduced down to the attributes we, the user want to search for.

The way main.js and index.js work is through passing request and responses to each other.
Main.js activates on client input and talks to the server ( the server started with 'npx nodemon index.js' ) and does actions based on that.

The hardest part here is getting the HTML we want with the info the server gives back to us. This however can be slightly ignored because i think if we can hammer out what we get from the terminal, then we will have the back end done ( as it is more important)

My goals for this are as follows:
    Be able to see all tables available
    Be able to insert, update those tables.
    Search for someone's INFO based of their employee_id
    I think if we can get these 3 things down, minimum, then we are good.
